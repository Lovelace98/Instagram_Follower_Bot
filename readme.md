# Project Title

## INSTAGRAM FOLLOWER BOT

## PROBLEM

Many start up brands often face the challenge of searching for similar accounts on Instagram and manually following all the users that follow those similar accounts. This process can be time-consuming and tedious, especially when dealing with a large number of accounts. 

## SOLUTION

Instagram follower bot is a bot that automates the process of searching for similar accounts on Instagram and following the users that follow those accounts. The bot leverages Instagram's API to retrieve the necessary data and performs the following tasks:

1. Account Search: The bot allows the client to specify a target account or a list of target accounts. It then searches for similar accounts based on various criteria such as follower count, engagement rate, and content relevance.

2. Follower Extraction: Once the similar accounts are identified, the bot extracts the list of users who follow those accounts. This data is collected and stored for further processing.

3. Automated Following: The bot utilizes the collected user data to automatically follow the identified users. It efficiently handles the follow requests, adhering to Instagram's limits and guidelines to ensure account safety.

By automating the process of searching for similar accounts and following their followers, instagram follower bot streamlines the client's workflow and saves valuable time and effort. It allows the client to focus on other essential tasks while still effectively expanding their Instagram presence and engaging with relevant users.
